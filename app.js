// The challenge is to build a calculator that has the same functionality as your iPhone calculator (portrait). You'll need the following to complete it:

// 1. Conditional Statement (If/Else as well as the &&/|| operators)
// 2. JS Functions (arrow functions covered this morning)
// 3. How to add event listeners (interacting with the DOM, covered fully on Thursday but covered a bit already with the validation lesson and responsiveness lesson from last week)
// 4. How to change the text with the (textContext)
// 5. For loops (to be covered tomorrow morning but you may have already come across them too)

// +	Addition
// -	Subtraction
// *	Multiplication
// **	Exponentiation (ES2016)
// /	Division
// %	Modulus (Remainder)
// ++	Increment
// --	Decrement
