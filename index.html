<!-- Create UI -->

<!-- Create a form in the UI where user can input values. Use JS form validation to check for correct inputs (e.g. no letters) -->

<!-- HTML elements will have classes such as ("1" "add" "=" etc to link to js) -->

<!-- add event listener for user inputs -->

<!-- Create function that take 2 + parameters. The function can then pass these parameters into whichever calculation type the user wants (e.g. add divide etc) -->

<!-- calculation is then returned and passed into the UI -->
